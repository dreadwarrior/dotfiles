\f[V]idea\f[R] command.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Manually syncing KeePassXC files between two devices is more secure than
using a cloud storage for keeping it in sync automatically.
.PP
The packaged \f[V]keepassxc-cli\f[R] binary of the KeePassXC application
on macOS supports exporting a KeePassXC database to a CSV file.
.PP
By using a diff tool, one can manually sync the database and then
re-import on the second device.
.PP
The command creates two temporary files in the working directory of its
execution.
After exiting the diff tool, you\[cq]ll have to hit any key in order to
proceed with cleaning them up.
